NAME
    DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::FS - store BLOBs in the file system

SYNOPSIS
      __PACKAGE__->load_components('InflateColumn::FS Core');
      __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
          id => {
              data_type         => 'INT',
              is_auto_increment => 1,
          },
          file => {
              data_type => 'TEXT',
              is_fs_column => 1,
              fs_column_path => '/var/lib/myapp/myfiles',
          },
          file_2 => {
              data_type => 'TEXT',
              is_fs_column => 1,
              fs_column_path => '/var/lib/myapp/myfiles',
              fs_new_on_update => 1
          },
      );
      __PACKAGE__->set_primary_key('id');

      # in application code
      $rs->create({ file => $file_handle });

      $row = $rs->find({ id => $id });
      my $fh = $row->file->open('r');

DESCRIPTION
    Provides inflation to a Path::Class::File object allowing file system
    storage of BLOBS.

    The storage path is specified with "fs_column_path". Each file receives
    a unique name, so the storage for all FS columns can share the same
    path.

    Within the path specified by "fs_column_path", files are stored in
    sub-directories based on the first 2 characters of the unique file
    names. Up to 256 sub-directories will be created, as needed. Override
    "_fs_column_dirs" in a derived class to change this behavior.

    "fs_new_on_update" will create a new file name if the file has been
    updated.

METHODS
  register_column
  fs_file_name
    Provides the file naming algorithm. Override this method to change it.

    This method is called with two parameters: The name of the column and
    the "column_info" object.

  _fs_column_dirs
    Returns the sub-directory components for a given file name. Override it
    to provide a deeper directory tree or change the algorithm.

  delete
    Deletes the associated file system storage when a row is deleted.

  update
    Deletes the associated file system storage when a column is set to null.

  _inflate_fs_column
    Inflates a file column to a Path::Class::File object.

  _deflate_fs_column
    Deflates a file column to its storage path name, relative to
    "fs_column_path". In the database, a file column is just a place holder
    for inflation/deflation. The actual file lives in the file system.

  table
    Overridden to provide a hook for specifying the resultset_class. If you
    provide your own resultset_class, inherit from
    InflateColumn::FS::ResultSet.
